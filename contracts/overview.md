# Overview

### Source Code

Our [contract source code is available on Github](https://github.com/avvydomains/contracts)


### Interacting with Contracts

Our [Resolution Utils Contracts](/contracts/resolution-utils/) are the best way to interact with the overall system. These contracts have simple interfaces for resolving values on .avax names.


### Deployments

[Contract ABI & mainnet contract addresses are available in our Client Common repository](https://github.com/avvydomains/client-common/blob/master/contracts/43114.json)


### Integration into Solidity projects

Integrators can install & import contracts in their solidity project via the `@avvy/contracts` package on NPM.
