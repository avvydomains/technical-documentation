# Overview

### Source Code

Our [contract source code is available on Github](https://github.com/avvydomains/contracts)


### Interacting with Contracts

Our [Client Libraries](/libraries/clients/) are the best way to interact with the contracts. The libraries handle the complexities of interacting with the contracts. Users wishing to directly query contract methods can also do so via the Client Libraries.


### Deployments

[Contract ABI & mainnet contract addresses are available in our Client Common repository](https://github.com/avvydomains/client-common/blob/master/contracts/43114.json)


### Integration into Solidity projects

Integrators can install & import contracts in their solidity project via the `@avvy/contracts` package on NPM.
