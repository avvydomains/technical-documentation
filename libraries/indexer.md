# Indexer

The Avvy Domains Indexer is a project meant to build a local representation of the current state of Avvy Domains. This project can be a useful tool for integrators who wish to have some queryable offline version of the .avax system.

[The Indexer is available on Github](https://github.com/avvydomains/indexer)
