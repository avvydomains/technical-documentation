# Client Libraries

We offer Client Libraries in various languages to handle the complexities of interacting with the Avvy Domains smart contracts.


### Libraries

Language | Package
--- | ---
Javascript | [`@avvy/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@avvy/client) (NPM)

If you need a library implemented in a specific language please reach out to us!


### Client Common

The Client Libraries all rely on a [Client Common project](https://github.com/avvydomains/client-common) which provides common static files like smart contract addresses & ABI as well as a list of Standard Record Types.
