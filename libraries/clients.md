# Client Libraries

**DEPRECATION NOTICE: The preferred way of interacting with the Avvy Domains system is to use the [Resolution Utils contract](/contracts/resolution-utils/).**


### Libraries

Language    | Package
---         | ---
Javascript  | [`@avvy/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@avvy/client) (NPM)

If you need a library implemented in a specific language please reach out to us!


### Client Common

The Client Libraries all rely on a [Client Common project](https://github.com/avvydomains/client-common) which provides common static files like smart contract addresses & ABI as well as a list of Standard Record Types.
